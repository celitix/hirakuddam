   <p>Jawaharlal Nehru Proudly called Dam as the temple of Modern India. Why so? He said this because dams can solve major problems that our country faces such as irrigation, flood, human consumption, and industrial processes. India has many dams but some of them have very much importance from a historical point of view. One of the best dams in India is the Hirakud dam. It is situated 15 km away from Sambalpur, Odisha. This dam is significant as it is the first major project after Independence that serves multiple purposes.</p>

   <h2>Historical Significance</h2>
   <p>Before the construction of the Hirakud dam, there was a grievous problem of flood in Mahanadi delta. To tackle this M. Visvesvaraya proposed the detailed plan to investigate the construction of a reservoir to contain the water of Mahanadi delta. In 1945 final approval was given for the construction of the Hirakud dam. In 1953 the construction was completed and was inaugurated by then Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru.</p>

   <h2>The Massive Structure</h2>
   <p>This dam is the longest earthen and is 25.8 km in length. It spans between two hills namely Laxmi Dungri on left and Chandili dunguri on right. It also forms the biggest artificial lake in India. There are also two observation towers on both sides of the dam. One is “Gandhi Minar” and another is “Jawahar Minar”.

   <h2>The Purpose Hirakud Serves</h2>
   <p>The first purpose that it served was that it controlled the flow of water and prevented flood. Second thing is that the dam is leveraged to produce electricity. There is a hydroelectric plant that is used to produce 307.5 MW electricity.</p>

   <p>This dam has also helped substantially to irrigate Kharif and Rabi crops in the Sambalpur district of Odisha.</p>

   <p>The dam is also suitable for the flora and fauna of the nearby area. A famous wildlife sanctuary called Debrigarh sanctuary is located here. Migratory birds visit this dam at regular intervals.</p>

   <h2>Stamps and Notes to commemorate this Dam</h2>
   <p>Stamps and notes were released by the Postal Department and RBI to commemorate the construction of this dam.</p>

   <p>Hirakud dam is not just a dam, it is an engineering marvel and an example of human competency to overcome the challenges put by nature. It shows that with an effort a problem that seemed insurmountable at first can be solved efficiently.</p>

    <p>The main purpose of the Hirakud Dam India was to check the massive flood that was effecting a large part of coastal Orissa. But construction of the dam greatly affected the native of western part of Orissa. Nearly 1.5 Lakh people got affected by the Hirakud project. Nearly 22,000 family were displaced by the dam project.</p>

    <p>After independence we have made lots of progress in Dam and water reservoirs, Now India is one of the world’s most prolific dam-builders. Around 4300 large dams already constructed and many more in the pipeline, Almost half of which are more than twenty  years old. These dams are major attraction of tourists from all over India.</p>

    <p>India’s longest dam is Hirakud Dam. Constructed on Mahanadi River this is situated in Indian state Odisha. Amongst the Dams of India this definitely holds a unique position. Hirakud dam is situated near Sambalpur District of Odisha. 15 kilometres from Sambalpur this is a milestone after Independence Of the country. This is a historic Dam.  Controlling the Mahanadi River was important.</p>

    <p>The dam currently has 98 gates, 64 sluice gates and 34 crest gates, to release flood-water. However, the CWC has recommended raising water discharge capacity of the dam by 1.5 times. Sambalpur faces flood-like situation when 30 gates of the dam are opened, releasing 8 lakh cusec of water. The new spillway(s) would release water into Jhari Jor beyond Chipilima to avoid flooding of the city.</p>

    <p>The Hirakud Dam with the channel provides best environment for wildlife. For the development of wild animals Hirakud Dam provides ideal conditions, so the Debrigarh wildlife sanctuary is located here in which thousands of species are leaving. Many species of migratory birds visit the reservoir during winter for a better atmosphere. Nearly 20-25 species of birds are seen in the reservoir. Some common birds are common pochard, red-crested pochard, great crested grebe and several others.</p>

     <p>Hirakud Dam stands in the Sambalpur district across the Mahanadi River. Hirakud is not only the longest earthen dam in Odisha but also the biggest artificial lake in Asia. Hirakud Dam was built in the year 1957 and which has a storage capacity of 743 sq km and a shoreline of over 640 km.</p>

     <p>The Hirakud dam in Odisha is 6 km from NH (National Highway) and 8 km from the Hirakud Railway Station. It is 61 m in height and 4801 m in length, stretching between the hills of Lamdungri in the left and the Chandili, Dunguri on the right. The dam has 21 km of dykes.</p>

     <p>The construction of Hirakud Dam dates back to the period of devastating floods in the year 1937. The foundation of the dam was laid by Sir Howthrone Lewis, the governor of Odisha , on 15th of March, 1946. A project report was provided to the government in June 1947. Jawaharlal Nehru officially inaugurated Hirakud Dam in the year 1957. The project had started functioning at its full capacity from the year 1966.</p>

     <p>This dam is elevated at 160 metres. Dams are huge constructed barriers that are made on water bodies. The purpose of making dams is to reserve water for various purposes. The flowing water of the river is of no use until it is being reserved. Hence dams restrict the water of the river from flowing and store it for multiple usages. The dams are constructed on rivers also to avoid flood like situations.</p>

     <p>The beautiful Dam is built 15 km north to the Sambalpur district. The Hirakud Dam is a complex structure that has been built across the River Mahanadi. The purpose of making this massive Dam was to store water for irrigation purposes and also to avoid floods.</p>

     <p>The Hirakud dam is more than a dam. It’s a matter of pride all together. After the Independence of India this was the first River valley project. It was a huge project. It is a landmark project that made the country proud. As a country that just got freedom, this project was a crowning project. It made India self-reliant.The free India as a country was still a child and such decisions made the country stronger.</p>
